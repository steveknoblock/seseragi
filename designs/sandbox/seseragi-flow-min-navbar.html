  <p>Self-contained demonstration of flow movement. This scrolls text in the section panel using the scroll bar on the browser window. It works by making the left panel stick while the right panel is not stuck so it still scrolls with the page. The left panel is sticky. The right panel is not. When the page is scrolled the left panel sticks to its immediate parent container. The right panel continues to scroll with the page.
