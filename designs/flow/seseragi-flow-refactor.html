  <!-- The container system is wrong. The background must display behind each text, whether or not it goes across columns or just behind a transparent grid, its not extending past the first column.

  What I want is

  
   back     back    back
  | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |

    I need a container for each column's content with a background graphic applied or I need a container behind all the columns with the graphic applied and visible behind transparent column background.

    The grid determines the number of columns but each column has a content container.
