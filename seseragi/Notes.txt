The only difference between the older version of Seseragi and the new is the header presentation. I can create two different headers to experiment with each.

The older page header is a gradient that extends downward until it merges into the page body. Its similar to the gradient that extends downward from the header into the page body on the newer design.

The newer header HTML is

<header>
  <hgroup>
    <h1 class="logo">Seseragi</h1>
    <h2 class="tagline">The sound of flowing water.</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <div is='panel-menu'></div>
</header>

and the older header is

<header id="ledge_container">
    <hgroup>
      <h1 id="logo">My website</h1>
      <h2 id="slogan">A lot of effort went into making this effortless.</h2>
    </hgroup>
   <!-- navigation goes here -->
</header>

They are nearly identical except perhaps for CSS styles.

The old header used floats to divide the header into left and right sections.

On the newer design, the gradient was removed from the header and folded into the navigation menu.

A class named 'panel' was defined to place the downward gradient behind any element, mostly used for creating visual separation between page sections.

The first section became essentially the top gradient for content such as text.

Or in other words, the gradient associated with text became part of the text instead of the page and the header became a non-gradient area.

They are somewhat opposites.


The old Seseragi design has a border creating a visual space for the "page" with the gradient behind it, and the text flowing underneath with or without a header above it.



I think

drop-cap where drop cap is applied without circle
drop-cap-circle where drop cap is applied with circle

class="drop-cap"
class="drop-cap-circle"

where there is an individual class for each type of drop cap and the name incorporates the inheritence

essentially

.drop-cap {
  // drop cap
}

.drop-cap-circle {
  //drop cap
  // draw circle
}

or

drop-cap where this is the base class
with-circle where this is a class that is composable with the base class
class="drop-cap"
class="drop-cap with-circle"

are best.
