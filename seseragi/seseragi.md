# Seseragi

New Seseragi static website theme.

# New

The new design will focus on a set of page types:

Home page (grid of cards)

Article page (A single article)

Index page (A page with links to other pages.)

Photos/mosaic page (Grid of images)

Flow page (Blog stream of posts page.)

What will these pages show?

An article page will show an article.


# Stylesheet

The stylesheet is divided into sections for Fonts, Base, Typography.

The Typography section is for only font import. No font-related rules, no margin, borders, padding, and the like. Try to put everything here that defines font usage, except for components, which may have their own internal font rules for fonts.
