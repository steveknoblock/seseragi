# Notes

Thinking of putting typography in a separate file only for font-related rules, no margin, borders, padding, and the like. Try to put everything here that defines font usage, except for components, which may have their own internal font rules for using fonts. I understand this means you can't look in one place for all the styles, but at least you know only font rules are in typography, padding, margins, dimensions are elsewhere.

Todo: Set line height, letter spacing and kerning?
