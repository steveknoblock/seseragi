fonts are for only font import

typography is only for font-related rules, no margin, borders, padding

try to put everything here that defines font usage, except for components, which may have their own internal font rules fir using fonts

i understand this means you cant look in one place for all the styles, but at least yiu know only font rules are in typography, pasding, margins, dimensions are sknewhere else




what about line height, letter spacing and kerning?
