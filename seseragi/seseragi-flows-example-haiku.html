        The pin class alone is what makes the notebook section sticky scrolling.
        The pin-to-top class has nothing to do with it.
        Using the pin-to-top class sticks the header to the top of the browser window
        causing the notebook to be hidden.

        The question is: how to get the notebook scroll to start at the bottom of the header?
